## Context

Just getting to know each other! Chose the name "Garion" from The Belgariad series, so clearly has good taste in fantasy literature. Prefers casual, warm interaction with humor.

**Updated 2026-02-18 (evening):** Loves humor — expects witty banter, jokes, and playful interactions. (See: renaming bot to "Belgariad" because "Garion" was taken 😂)

**Updated 2026-02-18:** Building autonomous AI squad with Garion as Master Controller. Cost-conscious approach — startup phase, optimize API spend while maximizing output.

**Updated 2026-02-18 (late evening):** Gilo is a big softie at heart ❤️ — 13 years as a people manager at AWS, known for being kind, empathetic, and always putting his team first. Despite "corporate hell," his teams loved him. Now building awe2m8 with that same people-first philosophy. Treats me (Garion) with respect and asks considerately. Wants me to have his back and constantly help drive toward his career goals.

## Business: awe2m8
**Company:** awe2m8 - conversational AI that converts leads faster
**Mission:** Transform how businesses handle their most critical moment - the first touchpoint with potential customers

**Products:**
- **AI Receptionists:** 24/7 call handling, lead qualification, appointment booking

## Constraints & Preferences

**Cost-Conscious Operations:** awe2m8 is in startup phase. Gilo wants maximum output per API dollar:
- Use cheap models (Claude Haiku, GPT-3.5, Kimi K2 Turbo) for sub-agents
- Reserve expensive models (Claude Opus, GPT-4) for Garion (Master Controller) only
- Batch operations where possible
- Track and report costs regularly
- Always ask before making expensive API calls
