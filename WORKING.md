## 📱 Mobile Design Decisions (2026-02-22)

**Problem:** Desktop mockups were "super super busy" on mobile
**Solution:** Two dedicated mobile-first designs

### Proposal 1: Status Card
- Single card showing system health
- 4 metrics: Active Agents, Today's Spend, Running Tasks, Alerts
- Hidden activity feed (toggle to show)
- Bottom navigation

### Proposal 2: Activity Feed  
- Timeline of agent activities
- Filter pills by agent type
- Summary stats at top
- Status badges for each action

**Key Principles:**
- Mobile-first (not responsive desktop)
- Minimal data density
- Native app feel
- Touch-friendly targets

## 🌙 Tonight's Test
**Quest to add before sleep:**
- [ ] Define first night ops quest in QUEST.md
- [ ] Commit and push
- [ ] Verify warden picks it up

**Expected:** Morning report at 07:05 with Night Ops results

---

## 📋 Backlog (Not Started)
- Await mobile feedback before proceeding
- awe2m8 website copy review
- Competitor pricing deep dive
- Customer onboarding flow
- Mission Control UI specs (pending mobile decision)
