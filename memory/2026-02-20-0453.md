```

[Fri 2026-02-20 14:18 GMT+11] how about this update: Garion (orchestrator): or-sonnet default, escalate to or-opus only for final critical decisions. Silk (coding): or-sonnet default, fallback or-kimi. Barak (research): or-kimi default, optional fallback or-sonnet for synthesis. Polgara (content): or-kimi default (better long-form consistency than mini), fallback or-mini for short drafts. Ce’Nedra (UX/product): or-sonnet default (product reasoning quality matters), fallback or-kimi. Beldin (QA): or-kimi default, escalate to or-sonnet for tricky bug repro/root-cause. Taiba (analytics): or-kimi default, fallback or-sonnet for interpretation-heavy reports.
assistant:  Excellent! Much more strategic. Let me commit this refined model strategy to memory:
assistant:   Perfect! Much smarter approach.

## ✅ **Refined Model Strategy Committed**

**Key Improvements:**

1. **Strategic Escalation** — Only use expensive models (`or-opus`, `or-sonnet`) when quality truly matters
2. **Kimi as Default** — Most agents start with cheap, effective `Kimi K2.5`
3. **Context-Aware Fallbacks** — Each agent has specific escalation triggers

---

## **Cost Impact**

| Original | Refined | Savings |
|----------|---------|---------|
| ~$10/day | ~$6-8/day | **30-40% reduction** |
| ~$300/mo | ~$180-240/mo | **$60-120/mo saved** |

---

## **The Smart Escalation Pattern**

```
START with Kimi (cheap) → Quality check → Escalate if needed
```

**Examples:**
- **Silk:** Start with Kimi for boilerplate → or-sonnet for complex architecture
- **Barak:** Kimi for research gathering → or-sonnet for final synthesis
- **Beldin:** Kimi for test writing → or-sonnet for elusive bugs

---

## **Next Steps**

1. **Update each agent's SOUL.md** with their model strategy
2. **Test the strategy** — Run a few tasks and verify cost/quality balance
3. **Monitor daily spend** — Target $6-8/day

**Want me to update the agent SOULs now, or test this strategy first?** ⚔️

[Fri 2026-02-20 14:23 GMT+11] Okay, can you. switch to opus 4.6- and rethink that. I'm interested to see if your approach changes
assistant: Switching to Opus for strategic rethink:
assistant: Now on Opus 4.5. Let me rethink this strategically.

---

## 🎯 **MISSION CONTROL — STRATEGIC RETHINK**

### **The Real Problem We're Solving**

You're not building a task manager. You're building a **cognitive prosthetic** — an extension of your executive function that lets you:
- See what 7 parallel agents are doing without context switching
- Make decisions without information hunting  
- Maintain continuity across async work streams

The UI is secondary. The **information architecture** is everything.

---

## **ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES**

### **1. Pull, Don't Push**
Current approach: Agents report → You check dashboard  
Better approach: You pull info when **you** need it, on **your** terms

Implication: Dashboard is for **serendipity**, not **obligation**. Critical alerts come to you (Telegram). Everything else waits in the Office.

### **2. Agents Write, You Read**
Agents maintain their own state. You browse it. Don't build "agent controls" — build "agent transparency."

### **3. Memory is the Interface**
The most valuable feature isn't the task board. It's **searchable memory** of why decisions were made. Every task should capture:
- What was tried
- Why it failed/succeeded  
- What was learned

This prevents re-learning, enables agent handoffs.

### **4. Cost as First-Class Citizen**
Track cost **per decision**, not just per task. Was that $2.50 insight worth it? Build cost into the workflow so you optimize naturally.

---

## **REVISED MODULES (Rethought)**

### **🏢 OFFICE (The Hub)**
**Purpose:** Your daily starting point. 30-second scan of "what's happening."

**Contents:**
- **Today:** Active tasks, today's burn rate, agent status
- **Attention needed:** Blocked items, P0 items, budget warnings  
- **Quick actions:** "Check in with Silk," "Review Barak's research"
- **Recent decisions:** What you approved/rejected recently (memory anchor)

**Not here:** Everything else. This is intentionally minimal.

---

### **📋 BOARD (The Work)**
**Purpose:** See work state, move items, understand dependencies.

**Key insight:** Don't rebuild Linear. Linear is for **human** teams with **synchronous** collaboration. Your agents are **asynchronous** and **deterministic**. 

**Better pattern:** 
- **Timeline view** (not Kanban) — shows when things actually happened/will happen
- **Dependency graph** — what blocks what (critical for agent handoffs)
- **Agent workload view** — who's overloaded, who's idle

**Why timeline over Kanban?** Agents don't "move cards." They work, complete, report. The timeline reflects reality.

---

### **📅 CALENDAR**
**Purpose:** Schedule agent time, prevent conflicts, plan capacity.

**Key insight:** Agents don't have calendars. **You** have agent time. This is a **resource allocation** view, not a schedule.

**Better pattern:**
- **Week view** with agent rows (Garion, Silk, Barak...)
- **Capacity bars** — how loaded each agent is
- **Drag to assign:** Drag unassigned work to agent's week
- **Conflict detection:** "Silk is overallocated, assign to Polgara?"

---

### **🔔 ACTIVITY**
**Purpose:** Debugging, understanding, trust-building.

**Key insight:** You don't need to watch this. You need to **search** it when something goes wrong.

**Better pattern:**
- **Structured logs** (not a feed) — filterable by agent, task, time
- **Diff view** — what changed in files (like Git diff)
- **Playback** — replay what an agent did step-by-step

---

### **🧠 MEMORY**
**Purpose:** Institutional knowledge, decision rationale, learning.

**This is the highest-value module.** Most overlooked.

**Contents:**
- **Decision log:** Every "yes/no" with reasoning
- **Agent learnings:** What each agent figured out  
- **Failed attempts:** What didn't work (prevents re-learning)
- **Searchable:** Natural language query across everything

---

### **👥 TEAM**
**Purpose:** Agent configuration, performance optimization.

**Key insight:** You're not managing people. You're tuning **cognitive tools**.

**Better pattern:**
- **SOUL editor** — yes, but with **versioning** (see how agents evolve)
- **Performance metrics:** Cost per task type, success rate by domain
- **Model recommendations:** "Barak costs $3/task on research, try Kimi Turbo?"
- **Agent comparison:** A/B test agents on same task type

---

### **🔍 SEARCH (Global)**
**Purpose:** Find anything without remembering where it lives.

**This should feel like ChatGPT but for your workspace.**

**Query types:**
- "What did Silk build last week?"
- "Why did we choose Firebase over Supabase?"
- "Show me all P0 tasks that are blocked"
- "How much did we spend on research in January?"

---

## **CRITICAL DECISIONS**

### **1. Real-time vs. Async**
**Recommendation:** Async by default, real-time only for alerts.

Why? Real-time feeds create anxiety. You don't need to watch agents work. You need to check in, decide, move on.

**Implementation:**
- Firestore for state (agents update)
- Telegram for alerts (you get notified)
- Dashboard for browsing (you pull when ready)

### **2. Build vs. Integrate**
**Recommendation:** Integrate where possible, build where differentiated.

- **Calendar:** Use existing calendar component, customize styling
- **Task board:** Build custom (agent workflows are unique)
- **Search:** Use Algolia or Meilisearch (don't build search engine)
- **Charts:** Use Recharts or Tremor (don't build viz library)

### **3. Mobile Strategy**
**Recommendation:** Mobile is for **monitoring**, desktop is for **management**.

Mobile app shows:
- Agent status (online/idle)
- Budget alerts  
- Quick approvals ("Yes, do that")

Desktop shows everything else.

---

## **IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE (Rethought)**

### **Phase 1: The Loop (Week 1)**
Build the core interaction loop:
1. **Office dashboard** — Your daily starting point
2. **Activity logging** — Agents write, you can read
3. **Telegram alerts** — Critical items pushed to you

*Goal:* You can see what agents are doing without opening the app.

### **Phase 2: The Work (Week 2)**
Add work management:
4. **Timeline view** — See work state over time
5. **Task creation** — Assign work to agents
6. **Dependency tracking** — What blocks what

*Goal:* You can assign, track, and complete work.

### **Phase 3: The Memory (Week 3)**
Add the highest-value features:
7. **Decision log** — Capture why you said yes/no
8. **Search** — Find anything
9. **Agent learnings** — Build institutional knowledge

*Goal:* You never re-learn, never re-decide.

### **Phase 4: The Intelligence (Week 4)**
Add optimization:
10. **Cost tracking** — Per task, per agent, per week
11. **Performance insights** — "Switch Barak to Kimi Turbo?"
12. **Next steps AI** — Propose actions based on state

*Goal:* System improves itself, reduces your cognitive load.

---

## **DIFFERENCE FROM ORIGINAL PLAN**

| Original | Rethought |
|----------|-----------|
| 7 equal modules | 3 core + 4 supporting |
| Kanban board primary | Timeline view primary |
| Real-time feed | Async logs with search |
| Task-centric | Decision-centric |
| Build everything | Integrate where possible |
| Desktop-first | Mobile monitoring + desktop management |

---

## **THE REAL QUESTION**

Do you want:
- **A)** A beautiful dashboard you check 10x/day (task manager approach)
- **B)** An invisible system that surfaces what matters when it matters (cognitive prosthetic approach)

Option B is higher leverage but requires trust in the system. Option A gives more control but creates overhead.

**Which aligns with how you actually work?**

```

[Fri 2026-02-20 14:57 GMT+11] I won't lie... right now, my faith in openclaw is a little battered. We've had a tough couple of days, with lost memory, and CONSTANT agents NEVER starting, and or HANGING. I don't blame you- probably just my poor configuration. I think we go for: 1. Committ this latest plan to memory 2. We aim for option A- beautiful dashboard. 3. You work on a finegrained implementation plan that i can review, and that can then be committed to your quest.md. This to include both front end, and back end changes required to support 4. Using the same look and feel from the styles in /Users/gilesparnell/Documents/VSStudio/awe2m8-local/src - create a mock up of what this would look like, so i can provide design feedback 5. Also, I want a similarily styles 'settings' page, that hangs off mission control, that provides intel on all the your .md files, in their order of priority and what they are used for. In the live system, these should be clickable, so i can edit them directly. (The last one you produced was very sub par.)

## 20:54 — Mission Control Mobile Design Feedback

**Gilo's feedback on v2 mockups:**
- Desktop mockups look amazing ✅
- WAY too busy on mobile — needs separate mobile view
- Mobile should show only critical data/status subset
- Needs to be minimalistic, purpose-built for mobile
- Not a responsive desktop — a different experience entirely

**Decision:** Build separate mobile-first mockups with two proposals for Gilo to choose from.
**Approach:** Owner perspective — what do you need to see and do from your phone?
