# 2026-02-09 - Mission Control Dashboard Integration

## Summary
Successfully integrated the "Mission Control" AI Agent Squad dashboard into the awe2m8-local project, cleaned git history of secrets/large files, and deployed to Vercel.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `/src/app/admin/mission-control/page.tsx` - AI Agent Squad dashboard with Agent cards, Kanban task board, Activity feed, and stats
- `/src/hooks/useAgents.ts` - Firebase real-time hook for agents, tasks, and activities
- `/scripts/seed-firebase.js` - Seed script for Firebase demo data (`npm run db:seed`)

### Modified Files
- `/src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Added Mission Control card (purple theme) linking to `/admin/mission-control`
- `/package.json` - Added `"db:seed": "node scripts/seed-firebase.js"` script

## Git History Cleanup
Had to rewrite git history to remove:
1. `mission-control/` folder - contained node_modules with large files (>100MB, rejected by GitHub)
2. `google-auth/` folder - contained OAuth client secrets blocked by GitHub push protection

Used `git filter-branch` to remove these from all 345 commits.

## Repository
- GitHub: `https://github.com/gilesparnell/awe2m8`
- Deployment: Vercel (auto-deploys on push)

## Firebase Collections Expected
- `agents` - Agent profiles (Agent A, Agent B, Agent C)
- `tasks` - Kanban tasks assigned to agents
- `activities` - Activity feed items

## Default Agents (Fallback Data)
- **Agent A** (green/Target) - Lead Qualification Analyst
- **Agent B** (blue/Bot) - Voice/SMS Workflow Architect
- **Agent C** (amber/FileText) - Content & SEO Strategist

## Local Dev
```bash
cd /Users/gilesparnell/Documents/VSStudio/awe2m8-local
npm run dev
