[Fri 2026-02-20 18:18 GMT+11] Okay, great that this is now done. Some feedback. There's a lot of scrolling required. Is it possible to slim things down a bit? So there is less scrolling? The badges don't need to be so big- can be thinner. Please make use of dynamic overlays to bring important information to the front, that doesn't necessarily need to be visiable all the time. Lets try again
assistant: 

Good feedback. Less scrolling, thinner badges, dynamic overlays. Let me rebuild both mockups with that philosophy — information density up, chrome down, details on hover/click.
assistant: Now the settings page — compact with overlays:
assistant: Both mockups rebuilt. Here's what changed:

**Dashboard:**
- Nav tabs + cost summary moved **into the header bar** — one line, always visible
- Title row is one compact line with action button
- Agent strip is now a **single horizontal row of pills** — hover any agent for a detail overlay popup
- Investigation board lines are **tighter** — each area is one dense row with inline progress bar + cost
- Activity feed is a **compact table** — time, emoji, description, cost all on one line
- Sidebar has **collapsible** cost-by-agent section (click to expand)
- Everything fits in roughly one viewport on desktop

**Settings:**
- Section headers are thin (just emoji + uppercase label + priority dot)
- File cards are **~40% smaller** — tighter padding, smaller text, priority shown as a 6px dot not a badge
- Agent SOULs are a **compact 4-column grid** instead of large cards
- File Load Order is **collapsible** (hidden by default via `<details>`)
- Clicking any file card opens a **modal overlay** with file content + Edit/Save buttons
- Way less scrolling overall

Open them:
```
open ~/.openclaw/workspace/mockups/mission-control-v2-dashboard.html
open ~/.openclaw/workspace/mockups/mission-control-v2-settings.html
```

Try hovering the agent pills on the dashboard and clicking SOUL.md on settings to see the overlays in action.

Why was your last message. Now on telegram
assistant: 

The last message was me telling you to open the mockups in your browser and try the hover/click overlays. Here's the short version:

**Both mockups are done and ready for review:**

```
open ~/.openclaw/workspace/mockups/mission-control-v2-dashboard.html
open ~/.openclaw/workspace/mockups/mission-control-v2-settings.html
```

Dashboard has hover overlays on agent pills, settings has a click-to-open file editor modal. Much more compact than the first attempt — less scrolling, thinner badges, info hidden until you need it.

Run those two `open` commands on your Mac and let me know what you think.

Can you deploy this to vercel so I can see in on my phone. Please post url
assistant: I'll deploy the mockups to Vercel so you can view them on your phone. Creating a quick static deployment now:
assistant: **Deployed!** 🎉

**URL:** https://mockups-6adipglmv-gilesparnell-9253s-projects.vercel.app

Tap that link on your phone — you'll get a simple landing page with two buttons:
- **Dashboard** — the compact dashboard with agent hover overlays
- **Settings** — the file browser with click-to-view file editor modal

Test the interactions:
- **Dashboard:** Hover (or tap) any agent pill to see the detail overlay
- **Settings:** Tap any file card to open the file viewer modal

Let me know how it looks on mobile and what changes you want before we start building the real thing.

Okay- looks amazing. But super super busy on a mobile device. I think we need a seperate view for mobile. Something a lot simpler - showing only a subset of critical data / status. Review all the designs you’ve seen, and consider minimalistic design- and what an owner would want to see and actions from a mobile device. Give me two proposals. Build the mocks. Make sure you don’t hang, writing small chunks. Comitt to memory
assistant: 

Good feedback. Mobile needs to be a completely different experience — not a responsive version of desktop, but a purpose-built view. Let me think about what an owner actually needs on their phone.

Let me commit your feedback to memory first, then build two proposals.
assistant: Now let me think about this properly. What does an owner check on their phone?

**Core mobile needs:**
1. "Is everything OK?" — quick glance health check
2. "What's happening?" — who's doing what right now
3. "How much am I spending?" — cost awareness
4. "Anything need me?" — blockers, alerts

Two proposals coming up. Writing in small chunks to avoid the hang issue.

Please update my open router key to this and restart the gateway: 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

[Fri 2026-02-20 21:58 GMT+11] can you share two mock ups of a mobile proposal, and deploy to vercel so i can see on my phone?
