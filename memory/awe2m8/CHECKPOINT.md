# 🔖 PRE-FLIGHT CHECKPOINT
**Created:** 2026-02-21 01:05 UTC
**Task:** Mission Control v3 Implementation Planning + Execution
**Status:** Planning phase — about to commit plan and start building

## Current State
- v2 plan reviewed and approved
- v3 mockups exist (office, mobile-a, mobile-b, settings)
- Existing codebase: 654-line monolithic page.tsx needs refactoring
- Have read-write access to project at /mnt/projects/awe2m8-local/
- File organization completed

## What I'm About To Do
1. Present final implementation plan for Gilo's approval
2. Begin Phase 1 execution (component refactoring)
3. Set up local dev server for testing

## Files I'll Be Modifying
- /mnt/projects/awe2m8-local/src/app/admin/mission-control/page.tsx (refactor)
- /mnt/projects/awe2m8-local/src/components/mission-control/* (new components)
- /mnt/projects/awe2m8-local/src/hooks/* (new/modified hooks)

## Recovery
If session dies mid-task, read this file + WORKING.md to resume.
