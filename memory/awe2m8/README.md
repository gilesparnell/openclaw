## Active Work

**Current Focus:** Mission Control v2 — Mobile-first dashboard redesign

See `/mnt/projects/awe2m8-local/docs/project/MISSION_CONTROL_V2_PLAN.md` for full spec.

## Key Decisions

- Mobile view should be minimal — not a responsive desktop
- Two mobile proposals built: "Command Pulse" (scroll) vs "Swipe Deck" (cards)
- Gilo prefers clear folder organization — always maintain structure
