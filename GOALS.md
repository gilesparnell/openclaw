## 🎯 PRIMARY NORTH STAR

> *"I want to make a difference in people's lives. I don't need to be a millionaire, but I want financial stability to see my kids, travel between South Africa and Australia, and never worry about money again. I want people to feel something, be moved, cry with joy."*

**Success = Happy Gilo + Healthy/happy loved ones + Financial comfort + Freedom to travel/experience the world**

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE REALITY (Right Now)

**Personal Crisis:**
- Going through divorce 💔
- Cash super short — burning through savings
- Monthly expenses: ~$15k post-tax
- Redundancy package spent over last year
- Severely burnt out from Amazon, took a year off

**Business Status:**
- ✅ **First revenue!** $2k setup + $399/month (2 customers, first payments last week)
- 50/50 split with Jesse (business partner, Lennox Head NSW)
- **Gap:** Need $10k/month by May to show traction (won't cover expenses, but proves trajectory)

## 📅 SHORT-TERM (3-6 Months): Survival + Proof

### Financial Targets
| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Monthly Recurring Revenue | **$10k by May** | Won't cover $15k expenses, but proves model |
| Customer Count | ~25 @ $399/mo | Or fewer with higher setup fees |
| Cash Runway | Preserve savings | Stretch until revenue covers costs |

### Product Milestones (Priority Order)

**1. Voice & AI Automation Solution** 🎯
- Current: Building on Go High Level + Assistable + Thinkrr
- **Goal:** Move toward *own* SaaS platform (reduce dependency on expensive tools)
- **Vision:** Replace GHL entirely with custom-built solution

**2. Automated Customer Onboarding** ⚡
- **Current:** Manual provisioning (numbers, workflows, prompts, SIP trunking)
- **Target:** Near-zero manual work
- **Requirements:** Automated, scalable, secure
- **NO:** Manual GHL setup, custom prompts, SIP config

**3. Website Design + SEO Automation** 🌐
- Using: Lovable → Vercel for rapid prototyping
- **Target:** Close to 1-click process
- Automation: Site creation from prompt → Vercel deploy → Domain provisioning → SEO optimized
- *Gilo doesn't want to do web design manually*

**4. AllConvos Self-Service** 🤖
- Platform: https://allconvos.ai/
- **Target:** Single-click signup + provisioning
- **Experience:** Voice agent on site → learns business → builds agent → provisions on platform → gives number + web widget

**5. Own Voice Platform** 🏗️
- **Goal:** Replace Thinkrr and Assistable entirely
- Build proprietary voice/SMS infrastructure

### Branding Strategy
- **awe2m8** — operational/B2B brand (doesn't roll off tongue)
- **AllConvos** — customer-facing brand (voice/SMS focused)
- Own both domains

## 📅 MEDIUM-TERM (1-2 Years): Scale + Optionality

### Financial Targets
| Metric | Target | Reality Check |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| ARR | **$1M** | Unsure if achievable with current service model |
| Team Size | TBD | Currently just Gilo + Jesse |
| Operational Model | **Heavily automated** | Garion + automation handle most operations |

### Team Growth
- **Current:** 2 founders (Gilo + Jesse)
- **Near-term:** VA for customer onboarding
- **Challenge:** Can't hit $1M ARR with just 2 people
- **Need:** Advice on additional services + optimal team size

### Exit Strategy
- **Preference:** Build to sell (acquisition)
- **BUT:** Open to keeping if model evolves
- **Why sell:** Don't want to work hard for *other people* anymore — happy to work hard for *own* thing
- **Philosophy:** Things change fast — stay flexible

### Business Consulting Angle 💡
- Leverage: 30+ years IT/software engineering + people management
- **Offering:** AI Agentic transformation consulting
- **Focus:** Dev process modernization, people management in AI era, team structure as AI replaces roles
